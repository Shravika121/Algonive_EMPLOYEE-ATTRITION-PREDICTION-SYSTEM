# Employee Attrition Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Employee Attrition Prediction System is a Machine Learning project that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the organization based on various factors such as job role, salary, work environment, experience, and performance metrics.

This project helps HR departments and organizations reduce employee turnover by identifying at-risk employees early.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a predictive model that:
- Analyzes employee data
- Identifies key factors affecting attrition
- Predicts whether an employee will leave (Yes/No)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
